                                (1896-1977) is widely regarded as the foremost Vedic scholar,
                                translator, and teacher of the modern era. He is especially
                                respected as the world’s most prominent contemporary authority
                                on bhakti-yoga, devotional service to the Supreme Person,
                                ShriKrishna, as taught by the ancient Vedic writings of India.
                                He is also the founder-acharya of the International Society
                                for Krishna Consciousness.
