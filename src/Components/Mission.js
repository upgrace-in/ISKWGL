                                    The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) was officially established in 1966 in America by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami.
                                    The philosophy of ISKCON is nothing but the philosophy of Sanantan Dharma. Sanatan means which has no beginning and no end. This is existing from the dawn of creation. It is the world’s most ancient religion. The main scriptures are The Bhagavad-gita (The Song of God), and the ShrimadBhagavatam (entire story of supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna).

                                <p>
                                    The principles and practices of ISKCON were taught by ShriChaitanyaMahaprabhu (1486-1532) through his dearmost associate NityanandaPrabhu and six of his principle associates, the Goswamis of Vrindavana, Sanatana, Rupa, Jiva, GopalBhatta, RaghunathaDasa and RaghunathaBhatta. And later by BhaktivinodaThakura (1838-1914), his son BhaktisiddhantaSarasvatiGoswami (1874- 1937) and SrilaPrabhupada (1896-1977) who spread Krishna consciousness all over the world in English Language.

                                    ISKCON’s history includes a disciplic succession (guru sisyaparampara). It draws its legitimacy from its place in a succession of spiritual teachers and disciples. There are four major disciplic successions, and ISKCON belongs Brahma-Madhva-Gaudiya lineage founded by ShriChaitanyaMahaprabhu in the 16th century.
